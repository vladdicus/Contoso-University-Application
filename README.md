# Contoso University Project - Colin Haugh for SPC COP2839
This repository contains the Contoso University application as written in the lecture. 

Features implemented are:
* Responsive layout using _Layout.cshtml to ensure adaptability across different screen sizes.
* Navigation bar added to the layout that renders consistently across all views.
* Repeating section extracted into a reusable partial view for improved maintainability.
* Error messages display clearly.

A screenshot of the application running on my machine can be found in the base directory.

You can run the project yourself by using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/contoso-university-mvc.git and running it yourself in Visual Studio.
